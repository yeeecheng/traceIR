# üëÜ TraceIR: Training-Free Contrastive Loss for Text-Guided Diffusion Image Restoration
***Computer Vision 2024 Final Project***

[Youtube DEMO LINK]()

## Environment Setup

Follow the steps below to clone the repository, set up the environment, and install dependencies. The code is tested on **Python 3.10**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yeeecheng/traceIR.git
cd directIR
conda create -n traceIR python=3.10 -y
conda activate traceIR
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Inference

To process the default image examples, run the following command. The pre-trained model weights will be automatically downloaded from Hugging Face and placed under the `checkpoints/` directory:

```bash
bash scripts/inference.sh
```
